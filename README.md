[AdGen](http://adgen.stevensbougault.co.uk/)

AdGen is a project I started and am actively working on. The primary goal of this project is to enhance my skills in web development, specifically focusing on React, Tailwind CSS, and API integration using Express. Additionally, this project is inspired by the need for a tool to assist my girlfriend, who is starting a recruitment business, in creating job advertisements effortlessly.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Express (for server)

## Project Overview

AdGen is a web-based tool designed to simplify the process of creating job advertisements. It offers an intuitive user interface for inputting job details and generates ad content based on the provided information.

## Features

- Interactive form for inputting job ad details.
- Real-time content generation using the GPT-3 API.
- Copy generated content to the clipboard.
- Toast notifications for user feedback.

## Hosting the Express Server

One exciting and challenging aspect of this project was configuring and hosting the Express server on a Virtual Private Server (VPS). This experience allowed me to enhance my command line and server management skills.
